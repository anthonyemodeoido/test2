Builder’s Club Q&A
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h1>Builder’s Club Q&A </h1><span class="padding-top"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>What is Builder’s Club? <br>
    It's an awesome new feature that will unlock your creative potential to design amazing rooms and games. </h3><span
        class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>How does it work? <br>
    You'll be able to drag furni to your room from a special menu, which we're calling the &quot;Builder’s Club
    Warehouse&quot;. There's an upper limit on how many furni you can take from the warehouse at a given time. The furni
    limit begins with a Basic Limit of Furni and will increase to 1000 upon becoming a member for the first time. You'll
    get another +250 each time you purchase another month of Builder’s Club membership. All furni limit upgrades are <b>permanent.</b>
    If you reach the limit, you can simply put back some items before taking more.</h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>Can I trade or sell these furni? <br>
    No, Builder's Club furni is only for designing rooms. If you pick up the furni it returns to your warehouse and your
    limit is adjusted. </h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>Will these furni go to my inventory if I pick them up? <br>
    No, Builder's Club furni doesn't go to your inventory. If you pick them up, your warehouse limit will be adjusted
    instead. </h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>How can I create custom plans for my rooms?<br>
    The floor plan editor lets you easily create custom floor plans, as well as the ability to move doorways, change
    wall height setting and change the direction Habbos face upon entry. Display the editor in the room that you want to
    edit by typing :floor or :bcfloor. Remember that you use the floor plan editor at your own risk. Some changes may be
    irreversible and you may lose the furni arrangement in the room. </h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>How will this impact the aftermarket values of furni? <br>
    We have taken precaution to minimize any impact to aftermarket furni values. Builder’s Club Furni cannot be traded
    and never appears in inventories or marketplace. The furni included in Builder’s Club are also available in the
    Habbo Catalogue for purchase and therefore not in scarce supply. </h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>What are the benefits of joining?<br>
    By joining you'll be able to build rooms and unlock them to allow friends to see your creation. You'll get a
    permanent expansion to your warehouse limit just for joining. Finally we'll give you a Builder’s Club badge to show
    your status as a creative room designer. </h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>

</h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>What happens to the furni if I run out of Builder’s Club membership? <br>
    The rooms you've built will become locked for visitors. You'll still be able to access the rooms yourself and even
    customize them. However, an active membership is required if you want to allow other Habbos inside. </h3><span
        class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>Will I have to rebuild my rooms if I run out of Builder’s Club membership? <br>
    No, the rooms you've built will remain on your account, but they will be locked for entry by other Habbos and will
    no longer appear in the navigator. Once you purchase Builder’s Club membership again, the rooms will again be
    searchable in the navigator and will once again allow visitors.</h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
